# KillerWebsite
Hello there!Thought of sharing the *code* of **my first website** built!

I included the HTML code of my entire website in the **index.html** file.

Now I included **style.css** to control the layout of my webpage,**normalize.css** that makes browsers render all elements more consistently and inline with more standards and **grid.css** to set up fluid grid in the basic HTML file.

Then,in order to include various icons in my website I downloaded files such as *ionicons.eot*, *ionicons.min.css*,*ionicons.svg*,*ionicons.woff* from [here](https://ionicons.com/).

In **queries.css** file media queries to trigger different breakpoints are included.

Now there are however some things we can do inorder to make some of the parts of our website work great in older web browsers.So, I used three Javascripts scripts to enable some of the new functionalities in older browsers.The first one there is **respond.js** which enables the browser to understand and execute CSS media queries which we need for responsive web design.The secnd script I used is **HTML5shiv.js** that enables us to use and style HTML5 elements in older browsers.The last one is **selectivizr.js** that allows us to use CSS3 pseudo classes.I used these scripts from [here](https://www.jsdelivr.com/)!These scripts are included at the bottom of **index.html** file.

To make sticky navigation work I used a simple jQuery plugin called **jquery.waypoints.min.js** taken from [here](http://imakewebthings.com/waypoints/).

In **script.js** I included some jQuery code for smooth scrolling effect which is taken from [here](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/jquery/smooth-scrolling/).

Finally,I created a favicon for my website from [here](https://realfavicongenerator.net/)!

I excluded the images used in my website to mention in the repository!
